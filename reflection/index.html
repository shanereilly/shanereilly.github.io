    <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>After serving over five years in the <a href="https://www.marines.mil/">Marine Corps</a>, I was ready to take on new challenges. I was accepted into the University of Cincinnati where I started pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In January 2020, I started my first co-op at <a href="https://www.radiancetech.com/">Radiance Technologies</a> in Beavercreek, OH. I returned there in September 2020 for my second rotation.</p>
<p>The co-op program has helped further both my technical and interpersonal skills. I have read a lot on the importance of developing &ldquo;T-shaped&rdquo; skills; knowing a subject deeply but also having a wide breadth of knowledge and being able to collaborate with others. My co-op experience has certainly helped me in these aspects. It has taught me a great deal about very niche areas while also exposing to a wide breadth of tools, technologies and concepts.</p>
<p>I was given the exciting opportunity to work on real and impactful projects and make direct contributions. While I knew I was going to be given real assignments, I didn&rsquo;t expect to hit the ground running the way I did.</p>
<p>As a non-traditional student, school has certainly been a learning experience for me, with its own share of ups and downs. Despite this, I&rsquo;m happy with the choices I have made and would not do anything different.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain I have found the career path that I would like to go down the rest of my life. With my remaining co-ops, I would like to continue to explore the various sub-disciplines of the security research field.</p>
<h2 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, my long-term career goals are to work as in security research. Whether that be as a reverse engineer, malware analyst or any of the other countless sub-disciplines remains to be determined.</p>
